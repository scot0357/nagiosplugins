Nagios Plugins
==============

* For instructions on installing these plugins for use with Nagios,
  see below.  In addition, generic instructions for the GNU toolchain can be
  found in the `INSTALL` file.

* For major changes between releases, read the `NEWS` file.

* For information on detailed changes that have been made or plugins
  that have been added, read the `ChangeLog` file.

* Some plugins require that you have additional programs and/or
  libraries installed on your system before they can be used.  Plugins that
  are dependent on other programs/libraries that are missing are usually not
  compiled.  Read the `REQUIREMENTS` file for more information.

* Individual plugins are self-documenting.  All plugins that comply with
  the basic guidelines for development will provide detailed help when
  invoked with the `-h` or `--help` options.

Send an email to <nagiosplug-help@lists.sourceforge.net> for assistance.
Please include the OS type and version that you are using.  Also, run the
plugin with the `-vvv` option and provide the resulting version information.
Of course, there may be additional diagnostic information required as well.
Use good judgment.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1.  If you are using the Git tree, you will need m4, gettext, automake, and
    autoconf.  To start out, run:

    	./tools/setup

    For more detail, see the developer guidelines at
    <https://www.nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html>.

2.  Run the configure script to initialize variables and create a Makefile,
    etc.

    	./configure --prefix=BASEDIRECTORY --with-cgiurl=SOMEURL

    Replace `BASEDIRECTORY` with the path of the directory under which Nagios
    is installed (default is `/usr/local/nagios`), and replace `SOMEURL` with
    the path used to access the Nagios CGIs with a web browser (default is
    `/nagios/cgi-bin`).

3.  Compile the plugins with the following command:

    	make

4.  Install the compiled plugins and plugin scripts with the following
    command:

    	make install

    The installation procedure will attempt to place the plugins in a
    `libexec/` subdirectory in the base directory you specified with the
    `--prefix` argument to the configure script.

5.  There are some plugins that require setuid.  If you run make install as
    a non-root user, they will not be installed.  To install, switch to root
    and run:

    	make install-root

That's it!  If you have any problems or questions, feel free to send an
email to <nagiosplug-help@lists.sourceforge.net>.
